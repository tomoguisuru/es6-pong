# Pong
Simple project using ES6 modules and classes to create a simple "pong" clone.

Left Paddle 
- "w" => up 
- "s" for down

Rigth Paddle
- "Up Arrow" => up
- "Down Arrow" => down

This project was inspired by Chris DeLeon's pong tutorial [code your first game](https://www.udemy.com/code-your-first-game/learn/v4/overview)

It's not perfect and should be considered a simple tinker app for now
